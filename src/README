Program SVDClus.

Dependencies:

RDKit - known to work with 2013/09, 2014/03 and 2014/09 version
Boost - known to work with version 1.50.0 and later
SVDLibC - known to work with version 1.34. Obtained from
http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/SVDLIBC via Google search for svdlibc
Qt - known to work with 5.2.1 and 5.3.1

Building on linux:

The following environment variables need to be defined:

RDBASE - pointing to top level of RDKit tree
BOOST_ROOT - pointing to top level of Boost tree
SVDLIBC_HOME - pointing to top level of SVDLibC tree

Then :
qmake svdclus.pro
make

will create an executable svdclus.
The program has an in-built help browser, which reads the file
svdclus_help_index.html.

It has been tested on linux under RedHat 5 and Centos 6 and Ubuntu 14.04LTS.
It has been known to work on a Mac, and has never been tried on a Microsoft
platform.

Note that on Centos 6.4 and 6.5, and presumably on earlier Centos 6
versions, the system gcc, 4.4.7, cannot compile completely Qt 5.3.0
and later.  If you are downloading and building Qt for SVDClus, you'll
need to get 5.2.1 or upgrade your compiler to at least 4.5.
