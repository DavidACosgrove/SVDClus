Svdclus is an interactive program for clustering molecules. It is
primarily a vehicle for experimenting with
spectral clustering, first used
in cheminformatics by Brewer(<A href="#Brewer_Ref">1</A>), although
the technique is relatively well-established in image analysis.  In
the case of cheminformatics, it involves extracting the eigenvectors
from a manipulated distance matrix for the molecules, as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Calculate the similarity matrix for the molecules based on
  fingerprints</LI>
<LI>Apply a Gaussian filter to the distances so that low similarity
  values are lowered further</LI>
<LI>Apply a threshold to the new similarity values, setting very low
  ones to zero</LI>
<LI>Use a Lanczos singular-value decomposition (SVD, hence the program
  name) to compute the top <I>N</I> eigenvalues and eigenvectors</LI>
<LI>Build the clusters from the eigenvectors, applying a threshold to
  the contributions each molecule makes to the eigenvector.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
As the description above may suggest to you, a major difference
between this clustering technique and others is that molecules can
appear in more than one cluster.  Indeed, without the final filtering
step above, all molecules would be in all clusters.  How well a
molecule belongs in a cluster is given
by its contribution to the eigenvector.  Most clusters have some
high-contribution members followed by a long tail of things with very
low contributions.
<P>
So as to allow easy comparisons with 
other techniques, k-means clustering and fuzzy k-means have also been implemented.

Svdclus is the result of a CASE studentship AstraZeneca had with the Gillet
group at Sheffield University, the student being Sonny Gan.  He did
all the hard work, investigating different parameter settings,
understanding the maths, etc., I have taken all that and cobbled it
into this program.  To enable its use by the widest possible audience,
it has been written in RDKit(<A href="#RDKit_Ref">2</A>),
an open-source cheminformatics toolkit largely due to Greg Landrum,
currently at Novartis. This includes both the fingerprint generation
and the depiction.

<P>
At its simplest, svdclus can be run with no command-line
arguments. However, it's more convenient to my mind to use arguments
to load molecules and data. They can always be loaded using menu
commands, though. Help->About SVDClus gives a full list of the
acceptable arguments.
</P>
<P>
Svdclus uses a <B>M</B>ultiple <B>D</B>ocument <B>I</B>nterface model,
where multiple windows can be open within the main pane, the windows
can be stacked, tiled, minimised, destroyed, etc.  One window is the
Molecules spreadsheet, which holds the SMILES strings and data. This
cannot be destroyed, though it can be minimised.
</P>
<H3><A name="File_Menu">File Menu</A></H3>
This menu allows for reading molecules (as SMILES files only, at the
moment), data files and also has the quit button. Data files are
expected to contain tables of values, either floats or ints. They must
have a space-separated set of column headings including one for the
molecule name. No spaces in a column heading, then, even if you
'protect' it with quotes.
<H3><A name="Fingerprints_Menu">Fingerprints Menu</A></H3>
Before you can do any clustering, you need some fingerprints.  You can
use the RDKit Circular/Morgan fingerprints (similar to Scitegic's
ECFP6) or the RDKit Linear fingerprints (similar to Daylight's
fingerprint). You can also read in your own from a file, in ASCII
format i.e. one line per fingerprint with a name and then a series of
1s and 0s, with or without spaces.
<H3><A name="Clusters_Menu">Clusters Menu</A></H3>
There are 3 clustering methods at the moment, 'Build SVD' is the spectral
clustering, and there's k-means, and fuzzy k-means too, for
comparison. Each pops up its own dialogue box.
<H4><A name="SVD_Dialog">SVD Dialog</A></H4>
The different fields are:
<UL>
<LI><B>Tversky Alpha, Tversky Beta.</B> An interesting possibility
  with spectral clustering is the use 
  of an asymmetric similarity metric such as Tversky, where the
  similarity of A to B is not necessarily the same as the similarity
  of B to A.  When such a similarity matrix is used in spectral
  clustering, two sets of clusters are produced, the U and V 
  clusters.  The SVD Dialog lets you set values for Tversky Alpha and
  Beta coefficients. By default they are both 1, which gives you a
  Tanimoto similarity. In this, the U and V clusters will be
  identical, so only one is created.
</LI>
<LI><B>Gaussian filter</B> controls the tightness of the Gaussian
  used when transforming the similarity  matrix. A larger value gives
  more zero similarities, a smaller, fewer.  The default is 10, which
  Sonny thinks works pretty well.
</LI>
<LI><B>Similarity threshold</B> is the maximum value that the transformed
  similarity can take - anything lower than that will be set to
  zero.
</LI>
<LI><B>Cluster threshold</B> is the maximum value of a molecule's
  contribution to an eigenvector that will result in its inclusion in
  the cluster.
</LI>
<LI><B>Overlapping clusters.</B> By default, the spectral clustering
  method produces overlapping or fuzzy clusters, i.e. ones where molecules can
  appear in more than one cluster. That's not always desirable,
  though, so non-overlapping or crisp clusters can also be made.  This
  is done by assigning a molecule to the cluster for which its
  contribution to the eigenvector is
  largest.<A name="Non_Overlapping_Fail"/A> In practice, this
  doesn't seem to be very useful for this reason: The eigenvectors are
  normalised to unit length. If four molecules are very similar, the
  most they can contribute to an eigenvector is 0.5 (sqrt( 0.25 )), if
  everything else has zero contribution. In practice, it will be a
  smidge lower than that, as zero contributions aren't allowed.  It is
  quite conceivable that another eigenvector might have one molecule
  with a higher contribution than that, with all the others much
  lower.  This means that that molecule will appear in the 2nd cluster
  under non-overlapping clustering rules rather than the 1st, where it
  is really a better fit. My personal view is that if you want crisp
  clusters, use a different clustering algorithm.
</LI>
<LI><B>First Num. Clusters, Last Num. Clusters, Num. Clusters
    Step.</B> As with other clustering methods, it's not clear with
  spectral clustering how many clusters are relevant and should be
  generated.  One guide to this is the eigenvalues of the
  eigenvectors, which, Sonny tells me, are generally above 1 for
  tighter clusters. That's a loose rule of thumb, though, and its
  not clear how many clusters that would be ahead of time, in any
  case.  The Lanzcos algorithm can be used to generate all <I>N</I>
  eigenvectors, where <I>N</I> is the number of molecules, but this
  is very inefficient. It's better to generate, say, 30, 40 and 50
  clusters and see what you get.  To make that easier, you can set
  it up to occur automatically with these fields in the dialog box.
</LI>
</UL>
<H4><A name="K_Means_Dialog">K-Means Dialog</A></H4>
<P>
K-means clustering is an iterative procedure with a random
start-point.  It's therefore best to do it more than once, in case you
hit a local minimum some distance from the global one.  The first
option in the dialog controls how many times it does this, with a
default of 10. It is optimising the <A href="#Silhouette_Score">silhouette
    score</A> of Rousseeuw (<A href="#Rousseeuw_Ref">3</A>). As with
SVD clustering, you can set up multiple clusterings in one go with the
dialog.  This is important for k-means, too, as again the optimum
number of clusters isn't easy to predict. The clusters are presented
in descending size order. This often means that the first cluster
looks rubbish, but if that's so then it is rubbish, it's the cluster
where nothing really fits, an artefact of the clustering process.
</P>
<H3><A name="Clusters_Window">Clusters Window</A></H3>
<P>
Each cluster set is shown in its own window.  The window comprises a
tabular view onto the clusters, and a text window containing
information about them, such as their <A href="#Silhouette_Score">silhouette
    score</A> and how long they took to generate. Each cluster member
is labelled with its name, its contribution to the cluster ('Cont=')
and its individual silhouette score ('S=').  In the case of the
K-Means clustering the contribution is the distance of the molecule to
the cluster centroid. In addition, if you hover over a cluster member,
all information about the molecule that is in the Molecules table will
be displayed as a tooltip.
</P>
<P>
Right-clicking on a clusters window brings up a small menu that enables
writing of the clusters to file and also turns on and off the
colouring of cluster members.  The colouring option allows the
background of each cluster member to be shaded according to activity
from bright green for the most active, to bright red for the least
active.  The dialog gives the option of changing the sense of the
comparison so that either a higher number is better (as in a pIC50 or
percent activity) or a lower number is better (as in an IC50).  Any
column from the data table may be used; missing values will be
coloured white.

<H3><A name="Silhouette_Score">Silhouette Score</A></H3>
<P>
The crisp silhouette score of Rousseeuw (<A href="#Rousseeuw_Ref">3</A>) is
a measure of the goodness of a cluster.  For
each molecule it is the mean distance to other cluster members divided
by the mean distance to the nearest other cluster. Campanello <i>et
  al.</i>(<A href="Campanello_Ref">4</A>) have extended it to
overlapping or fuzzy sets by scaling each molecules crisp silhouette
score by its contribution to the cluster in question.  As such, it
suffers from the failing of the non-overlapping clusters from spectral
clustering mentioned <A href="#Non_Overlapping_Fail">above</A>.
